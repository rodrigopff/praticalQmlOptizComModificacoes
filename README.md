This is the code repository for [A Practical Guide to Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Optimisation ](https://www.packtpub.com/product/a-practical-guide-to-quantum-machine-learning-and-quantum-optimisation/9781804613832?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**Hands-on Approach to Modern Quantum Algorithms**

## What is this book about?
This book introduces the main quantum algorithms that are currently used in optimization and machine learning. The approach is hands-on, with examples that can be run on simulators and actual quantum computers. The algorithms are explained in full detail, without sacrificing rigor, but, at the same time, keeping mathematical prerequisites to a minimum.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Review the basics of quantum computing
* Gain a solid understanding of modern quantum algorithms
* Understand how to formulate optimization problems with QUBO
* Solve optimization problems with quantum annealing, QAOA, GAS, and VQE
* Find out how to create quantum machine learning models
* Explore how quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks work using Qiskit and PennyLane
* Discover how to implement hybrid architectures using Qiskit and PennyLane and its PyTorch interface

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import dimod
J = {(0,1):1, (0,2):1}
h = {}
problem = dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel(h, J, 0.0, dimod.SPIN)
print("The problem we are going to solve is:")
print(problem)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for professionals from a wide variety of backgrounds, including computer scientists and programmers, engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. Basic knowledge of linear algebra and some programming skills (for instance, in Python) are assumed, although all mathematical prerequisites will be covered in the appendices.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 2-12 | Anaconda | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
| 2-12 | Google Colab | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |

## Errata

- In Figure 1.2 of the digital version of the book (not of the print version), the ket 0 should be on the positive Z axis (i.e., on the top), and the ket 1 should be on the negative Z azis (i.e., on the bottom). Since we got the figure right in print, would the figure's correctness be in a state of superposition?

- References to the "_time-independent_ Schrodinger equation" (pages 14 and 126 of the print version) should be read as references to the "_time-dependent_ Schrodinger equation". 

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/FtU9t).
